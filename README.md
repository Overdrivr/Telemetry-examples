# Collection of examples for the Telemetry library

The `Telemetry` library facilitates greatly communication, exchange of data, fast prototyping and debug with Arduino/ARM Mbed applications.

This repository is a growing collection of examples to get some inspiration from, understand the library.

# Arduino

* Publish (send) some message from the Arduino
* Publish numbers from the Arduino and plot them with the command line interface
* todo : Toggle a led remotely using the command line interface
* todo : Toggle a led remotely using a python script
* Subscribe (receive) numbers from the PC inside the Arduino

# Mbed

* Radiocontrolled car : Control an RC car from your computer ! (NXP Cup line-following car)
* todo : sensor demonstration on a KL25Z
* todo : NXP Cup all telemetry : Reads all available data from linescan camera to HBridges of the NXP Cup line following car
* todo : display messages sent from the computer on the TFT-LCD of the KL46Z
